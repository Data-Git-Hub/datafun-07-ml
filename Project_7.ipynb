    "This project introduces fundamental machine learning concepts using **simple linear regression**—a type of supervised learning. By leveraging Python and several key libraries, we will build models, make predictions, visualize data, and publish our insights. The approach is inspired by concepts and examples from *Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science* by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel, specifically from:"
