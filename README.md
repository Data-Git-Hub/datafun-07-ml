# Introduction to Machine Learning

This project introduces fundamental machine learning concepts using **simple linear regression**—a type of supervised learning. By leveraging Python and several key libraries, we will build models, make predictions, visualize data, and publish our insights. The approach is inspired by concepts and examples from *Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science* by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel, specifically from:

> **Note:** This project is executed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Build a Model

In this section, we:
- Load data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Use various tools and techniques to prepare our data.
- Build different types of models, focusing primarily on simple linear regression.

---

## Make Predictions

Here, we:
- Use our trained models to predict future values.
- Draw the best-fit line through our data using simple linear regression.
- Extrapolate future values by asking, "For a given x-value (future data point), what is the predicted y-value on the line?"

---

## Visualize the Data

To understand our model and data better, we:
- Create visualizations of the raw data.
- Plot the best-fit regression line over the data.
- Utilize libraries such as **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for effective data visualization.

---

## Publish Insights

The final step involves:
- Analyzing the predictions relative to actual outcomes.
- Present our findings and reflect on the performance of different approaches.
- Sharing insights on what worked, what didn’t, and possible improvements for future modeling.
